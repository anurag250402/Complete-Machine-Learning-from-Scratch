# Machine Learning Repository

This repository contains various machine learning models implemented in Python. It includes examples of different algorithms and techniques used in data science and machine learning tasks.

## Files Included:
- **Decision_Tree.ipynb**: Implementation of a decision tree classifier for classification tasks.
- **Linear_Ridge_and_Lasso.ipynb**: Demonstration of linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression.
- **Logistic_Regression.ipynb**: Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification problems.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells to execute and test the models.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, etc.

Feel free to fork the repository, make contributions, and explore the implementations!
